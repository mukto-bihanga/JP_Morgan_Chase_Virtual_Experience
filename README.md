# JP Morgan Chase Virtual Experience
I assisted with some development of an alternative way to visualize and analyze share price data for JP Morgan's traders â€“ this will alert them of potential trading opportunities.

There were four tasks to be completed.

## Task 1
### Problem:
The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualize when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

Develop interface with stock price data feed.

## Task 2
### Problem:
Typically, traders monitor stock prices and trading strategies by having data displayed visually on their screens in chart form. Often these charts will be accompanied by alerts that notify users when certain events occur or when preset price thresholds are hit.

JPMorgan Chase created the Perspective tool over many years to allows users to present and manipulate data feeds visually in web applications.

Implement the Perspective open source code in preparation for data visualization
